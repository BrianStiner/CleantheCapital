# CleantheCapital
Welcome to CleantheCapital! We are a pressure washing and exterior cleaning business based in Salem, OR. Our services include pressure washing, soft washing, brushing, and repainting.

At CleantheCapital, we believe in providing quality services that make a positive impact on our community. That's why we offer free cleaning services for public areas in Salem, as well as a name-your-price special for private properties in Salem limits if you cannot afford market rates. We want to ensure that everyone has access to clean and well-maintained spaces.

In addition to the physical benefits of our services, we also believe in the mental health benefits of a clean and organized environment. A clean space can help reduce stress and anxiety, and improve overall well-being. We're proud to offer these benefits to our community through our cleaning services.

Furthermore, we understand the importance of maintaining clean public spaces for homeless individuals in our community. We strive to provide a safe and clean environment for everyone, and our team is trained to handle these situations with compassion and respect.

As a sole proprietor, I take great pride in my work and strive to deliver exceptional results for all of my clients. I also enjoy making videos of my cleaning process to share with others and provide an inside look at what we do.
